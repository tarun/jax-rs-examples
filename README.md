Jersey 2 JAX RS Examples

Many blog posts and examples out there focus on Jersey 1.x and Providing a REST service

I would like to create various examples which would also feature

1. JAX-RS Api instead of Jersey Custom Api
2. Featuring Service Clients


Libraries Used

1. [JAX-RS](http://jax-rs-spec.java.net)
2. [Jersey 2](http://jersey.java.net/)
3. [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)
4. [Moxy](http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/moxy.php)

	Look at the maven pom files for more details.
